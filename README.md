#Hi I'm Gabe welcome to my GitHub
###Previous coding experience
I'd say I'm between an intermediate and a beginner at coding, I know my way around p5js and how to work with functions conditions etc. but I'm yet to create a large project which really showcases my skills I've just been practicing over the summer following TheCodingTrain series on p5js and doing little projects which utilize what was tought within the video in ways that I'm passionate about.
