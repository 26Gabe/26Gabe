# Hi I'm Gabe welcome to my GitHub

 ### Previous coding experience
 <span style="color:blue;">
   <span style="color🖥️;">
I'd say I'm between an intermediate and a beginner at coding, I know my way around p5js and how to work with functions, conditions, etc. I've  been practicing over the summer following TheCodingTrain series on p5js and doing little projects using what was taught within the video in ways that I'm passionate about.

 ### Reasons for taking this class
I've always been interested in coding, but haven't really had the time or taken initiative to start making projects, but now since coding is a part of my schoolwork it'll give me a good way to start coding. Also I believe it'll be applicable to other projects I have, and it lets me use the time that I'd otherwise be honestly wasting in art.

 ### Other interests
I'm Interested in Physics, Math, and Business, but I'm not sure how or where these interests could combine and take me, maybe engineering or something similar. Also I play defense in soccer which is fun becuase I get get to spend time with my freinds and defense is the best part of soccor. I also do science fair and I want to incorporate coding into this years science fair.

 ### Goals I have for comp-sci and projects I want to complete
 One goal would just to be stay motivated, I've heard this class is a class where you have to take initiative as a student, what you get out will only be as much as you put in so I want to keep up the effort over the year. For projects, I want to do physics-related projects and data science projects, I want to start comp-sci with a spring-related project where you can adjust the weight on the bottom of the spring and the tightness of the spring which I think is possible. I also want to learn how to use complicated vectors, lists, arrays, and maybe a little AI.
