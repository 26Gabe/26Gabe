 #Hi I'm Gabe welcome to my GitHub
 ###Previous coding experience
I'd say I'm between an intermediate and a beginner at coding, I know my way around p5js and how to work with functions conditions etc. but I'm yet to create a large project which really showcases my skills I've just been practicing over the summer following TheCodingTrain series on p5js and doing little projects which utilize what was tought within the video in ways that I'm passionate about.

 ###Reasons for taking this class
I wont say that computer science is necessarily the way that I want to go with my life but what I will say is that I am very interrested in it, believe it will be applicable to other projects I have, and lets me utilize the time that I'd otherwise be honestly wasting in art experimenting with something I'm passionate about

 ###Other interests
Honestly, I'm Interested in Physics, Math, and Business, but I'm not sure how or where these interests could combine and take me, maybe engineering or something similar. This year I want to join the debate to talk more assertively and fluidly. I do a science fair and this year I want to be able to learn how to create a generalized linear model to create a project similar to Emily Ocasio who has a political science project that interested me that I want to create a different version of.

 ###Goals I have for comp-sci and projects I want to complete
 One goal would just to be stay motivated, I've heard this class is a class where you have to take initiative as a student, what you get out will only be as much as you put in so as a student I want to put in a continuous effort to every class and project. For projects, I want to do physics-related projects and data science projects that follow a road map that would allow me to create a generalized linear model by around winter break, I want to start with a project that would recreate a spring moving up and down with a weight where the user can adjust the weight and "tightness of the spring" which I think is possible. I also want to learn how to use advanced vectors.
