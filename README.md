 #Hi I'm Gabe welcome to my GitHub
 ###Previous coding experience
I'd say I'm between an intermediate and a beginner at coding, I know my way around p5js and how to work with functions conditions etc. but I'm yet to create a large project which really showcases my skills I've just been practicing over the summer following TheCodingTrain series on p5js and doing little projects which utilize what was tought within the video in ways that I'm passionate about.

 ###Reasons for taking this class
I wont say that computer science is necessarily the way that I want to go with my life but what I will say is that I am very interrested in it, believe it will be applicable to other projects I have, and lets me utilize the time that I'd otherwise be honestly wasting in art experimenting with something I'm passionate about

Other interests (academic or otherwise). 
Goals you have for this class and/or projects you'd like to complete.
